<h3>Ms.olumogba</h3>

<p><b>Hello!</b></p>
<img src="/images/about/crowd.avif" style="width:350px;">
<pre><i>
My name is Moradeke. You can call me Radeke or Rady for short.
The love for mathematical modelling after creation led me to Electronic Engineering.
The world is complex and exciting.

The ability to discretize that and conceptualize it for our reach thrills me.
More than that, it becomes actionable for implementation -
how awesome. Bridging the Arts with Science is where I see Engineering sits -
together with my mathematical capability -
is my reason for venturing into it.

The creative problem solving through Science for humanitarian or utility aims propels me in this domain.

Georgia Tech, The Georgia Institute of Technology is where I received my Bachelors, 
and then the Masters is from the Brunel University London
Through research and employment I'd like to learn, 
enhance my skills, grow in discernment of my place in.

<p><b>The Processing and Classification of EEG Vowel Signals in Imagined Speech.</b></p>
<p><b>Deep Learning Project, ML sub-set.</b></p>
<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
<pre><i><small>
This report is a response to the previous report by C. Nguyen, G. Karavas, P. Artemiadis on,
“Inferred Imagined Speech using EEG signals: a new approach using Riemannian Manifold features",
Journal of Neural Engineering, July 2017 [1].
It confirms that Imagined speech has potential within BCI.
This report makes an investigation on how to optimise and whether or not, 
this research can justify the decoding of EEG signals from coma patients.
The design aspect comes from the manipulation of the LSTM architecture layers and focuses on an investigation of hyperparameters,
and parameters for optimization of vowel sound training when a patient is in resting condition, only.
Vowel classification is improved upon from Nguyen, Artemiadis and Karavas’ work [1].

<h2>Ambition and future plans</h2>
<pre><i>
To entrepreneurially solve challenges through chip and circuit design would be fantastic.
Delivering sustainable, aesthetically pleasing and robust solutions in service of end users is my aim.
I delight in helping clients. The whole process of listening and asking questions to understand the pain points,
the underlying motive and purpose, along with the circumstances -
I am curious - brings me to forsee consultancy.
